# Slangbook

Little app I personally use to study Thai in everyday life.
Can be used for every other language too.
With slangbook you can learn a language your own way and write down exactly the phrases you want to know in real life.
It's a quick way to save phrases and find the right word easily on your phone.
This enables you to immediately write down a phrase when someone translates it for you. Later on you can search for phrases to use in a given situation.
You can access your phrases on any device and search for the right words.

## Status
It's only optimized for iOS at the moment and you have to set up your own instance to use it.
This is just a quick hack focused on personal use.
Please stay tuned for an all new more sophisticated version!
I'm working on a service to create your own slangbooks and to collaborate with others.
