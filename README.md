# Slangbook

Little app I personally use to study Thai in everyday life.
Can be used for every other language too.
It's a quick way to save phrases and find the right word quickly on your phone.
This enables you to immediately write down a phrase when someone translates it for you. Later on you can easily search for phrases to use in a given situation.
You can access your phrases on any device and search for the right words without internet connection.

(only optimized for iOS at the moment)
